					<h3>Terms & Conditions</h3>

						Terms and conditions by Wikipedia.
						Terms of service
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
"Terms of Use" redirects here. For Wikipedia's Terms of Use, see our Terms of Use.

Terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions, commonly abbreviated as ToS or TOS and TOU) are rules which one must agree to abide by in order to use a service.[1] Terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer, especially regarding the use of websites.

Usage

The Terms-of-Service Agreement is mainly used for legal purposes by websites and internet service providers that store a user's personal data, such as e-commerce and social networking services. A legitimate terms-of-service agreement is legally binding and may be subject to change.[2]
Content

A terms-of-service agreement typically contains sections pertaining to one or more of the following topics:

    Disambiguation/definition of key words and phrases
    User rights and responsibilities
        Proper or expected usage; potential misuse
        Accountability for online actions, behavior, and conduct
        Privacy policy outlining the use of personal data
        Payment details such as membership or subscription fees, etc.
        Opt-out policy describing procedure for account termination, if available
    Disclaimer/Limitation of Liability clarifying the site's legal liability for damages incurred by users
    User notification upon modification of terms, if offered

Public awareness

Terms of service are subject to change and vary from service to service, so several initiatives exist to increase public awareness by clarifying such differences in Terms, including:

    Copyright licensing on user content
    Transparency on government or law enforcement requests for content removal
    Notification of government or third-party requests for personal data
    Transparency of security practices
    Saved or temporary first and third-party cookies
    Data tracking policy and opt-out availability
    Pseudonym allowance
    Readability
    Notification and feedback prior to changes in Terms
    Availability of previous Terms
    Notification prior to information transfer in event of merger or acquisition
    Indemnification or compensation for claims against account or content
    Cancellation or termination of account by user and or service
